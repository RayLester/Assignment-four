Start by loading everything that is necessary to start the assignment
```{r}
#Loading the training and test libraries as well as the packages I will need
library(needs)
needs(tidyverse, magrittr, psych)
load("eye_FR_testdata-1")
load("eye_FR_traindata-1")
```
Question 3 - explore the data with summary statistics
```{r}
#Working with training data set only initially
summary(traindata)
#not very useful because outcomes are largely binary
min(traindata$lineuprt)
max(traindata$lineuprt)
#Indicating a huge range 
describe(traindata$lineuprt)
#describes data overall
describeBy(traindata)
#describes data by lineupacc
describeBy(traindata, traindata$lineupacc)
#tells me that 55 people were coded 0, and 62 were coded 1- this corresponds to the lineupacc groups
table(traindata$lineupacc)

#we need to change variable classes
#
traindata.fac.dat <- traindata %>% 
  mutate(lineupaccfac = as.factor(lineupacc))
#need to log (reaction time variable)
traindata.fac.log.dat <- traindata.fac.dat %>% 
  mutate(ractionlog = log(reactiontime))
  

#Making a box plot
traindata %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = automatic, x = lineupacc))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  gom_jitter(aplpha = 0.4)
facet_grid(exposure~lieupta)

mosaicplot(~linuppta + exposurre + linupacc, data = traindata)
#go row by row

```
